## Contributor Guidance for Google Summer of Code

## General guidelines

* Read the [Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) written by the Google Summer of Code organizers.
* Go through the [GSoC 2026 Project Ideas List](./2026/project_ideas.md) and read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Understand the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), application process and the project you are applying for, assuming best intentions throughout the period.
* Join our [Slack Channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CFFDS2Z7F) and introduce yourself. 
* Ask for any development-related help in the `#prometheus-operator-dev` channel.
* Start your proposal as early as possible following the template below. If you're new to Prometheus-Operator, try out our [getting started guide](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/quick-start/).
* Other form of contributions like helping out on Slack, GitHub issues, and reviewing pull requests are also most welcomed. We'd prefer contributors who can not only contribute to the codebase of Prometheus-Operator but can also contribute to the community around it.
* We hold [bi-weekly contributor office hours](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#office-hours-meetings), which can also be used to get synchronous guidance for your proposal. 
* Make sure to reach out and interact with the mentors to discuss your solution and approach towards a project idea before starting to fill in the proposal.
* Share the proposal link as text, markdown, Google docs or anything else as long as it is easy to share, and will not require anyone to download something.
* Final proposals should be submitted on the Google Summer of Code website before the deadline.

## How will the candidates be evaluated?

The GSoC process expects candidates to submit a formal proposal which gets evaluated by the GSoC mentors. Having a good proposal accounts only for a part of the evaluation result. Mentors also take into consideration how the candidate interacts with the community, including (but not limited to) contributions to the code base and documentation, helping out users (GitHub, Slack), mindful discussions with the maintainers, etc.

## Picking up and working on issues

* Please feel free to pick up any [good-first issues](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). If you're already familiar with the project, you are welcome to help out with other issues as well.
* Communicate your intention to work on the issue by commenting on it.
  * It reduces the risk for other contributors working on the same issue.
  * Maintainers can check that the issue is still valid, provide additional context and advise on the implementation.
* If a pull request from another contributor exists for the issue but it seems to be stale, it is ok to ask the permission to take over the work. If the answer is positive, make sure to give credits to the original contributor using `Co-Authored-By: ...` in your commit messages.
* Code isn't the only way you can contribute to the project, you can also review and comment on pull requests from other contributors. Make sure that your questions and comments are relevant for the contributor and the other reviewers.
* In case of doubt, please reach out on Slack and we'll help you find a suitable issue for you.

## Writing your proposal

* Your proposal should contain a clear understanding on how you're going to approach the project idea. Do not worry too much on building a schedule for the whole project, we'll build this together once the mentoring starts.
